# Urgentem_task

We need an automated process to download, clean, and estimate some sovereign-related carbon emissions data.

The data we are interested in can be downloaded from  https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/access-data. We are interested in the dataset with the description:
For each country in the dataset, we have used sensible approach to estimate the following fields for F2019 (you will notice these are not fully populated for all countries).

C02 Emissions Embodied in Final Domestic Demand
C02 Emissions Embodied in Gross Exports
C02 Emissions Embodied in Gross Imports
C02 Emissions Embodied in Production

Made this fully automated as possible and try to avoid any manual downloading, storing, or cleaning in excel.

The deliverable are be the following:
1. The fully populated dataset in an excel format. 
2. A pdf file with data analysis graphs with some commentary.
3. Python script with well documented code and comments. Provided detailed comments in the code to explain any assumptions or methods used for estimating values.
